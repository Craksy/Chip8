CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker.
It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in
the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made
to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.

It's a little toy project I made to get familiar with C#.
Additionally i rushed through a lot of it, just to get to a working prototype.
As a result it's probably filled with weird solutions and questionable design
decisions.
The experienced C# developer may cringe a bit over it. You've been warned.
Suggestions and feedback is very welcome, and would be greatly appreciated.
